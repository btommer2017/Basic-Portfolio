                    Hi, I'm Ben, nice to meet you.  I recently enrolled in a coder boot camp at the University of Minnesota and am finally learning the skills needed to create and design web pages, something I have wanted to learn for a long time.  I am very excited about this opportunity.
                    I'm hoping for a career change to something much more fulfilling and meaningful.  My current job as a surveyor for MnDot just doesn't do it for me and mosst of the time it is very boring, making the days seem way longer than they should be.  
                </p>

                    When I am not working, I enjoy many things.  Biking, hiking, camping, skiing, world travel, basketball, golf, finding new music, weightlifting and exercise, watching shows on Netflix, and having fun with my 2 cats, IV and Lynx.  Most importantly though, I enjoy spending time and doing activities with my wife.
